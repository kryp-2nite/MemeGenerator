Hello, I made this meme generator to get good practice with calling an AIP as part of my code. The challenges that i face was getting the API call to work correctly, and making sure my code in general was working as it should.
for this project, i used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React framework.
I had a lot of fun making this mini project, definitely help with making calls to an API.
